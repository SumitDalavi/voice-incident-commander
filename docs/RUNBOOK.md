## Prerequisites
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Node.js (v22+) or Python (3.12+) depending on the project
- `make` utility

## Setup
1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   make setup
   ```
2. **Start the local environment:**
   ```bash
   make dev
   ```

## Common Commands
- `make dev`: Starts the application and observability stack.
- `make test`: Runs the test suite.
- `make clean`: Removes node_modules, builds, and resets Docker volumes.

## Troubleshooting
**Port Conflicts (9090, 3000):**
If `make dev` fails due to bound ports, verify that no local Prometheus or Grafana instance is running. The `docker-compose.yml` can be modified to map to alternate host ports if necessary.

**Build Errors:**
Run `make clean && make setup` to completely clear the cache and reinstall dependencies from scratch.
